	<p>This is my first webpage in my coding journey, i hope to test my creativity and see what cool things i can come up with using these tools. I've always wanted to try my hand at something like this but it seems so difficult. So far its not too bad but i know it gets a lot harder. Im ready for the challenge.</p>
